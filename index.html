      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a consultant at the World Bank, specializing in public finance, taxation, and development economics, and I will soon start a PhD in Economics at the University of Barcelona. My academic background includes a Master’s degree in Economics from Universidad de San Andrés and a Bachelor’s degree from the Universidad de Buenos Aires, where I graduated magna cum laude. Over the past several years, I have gained extensive experience conducting applied research at institutions such as the World Bank, the University of Zurich, and the Inter-American Development Bank. My work has spanned diverse areas including impact evaluation, behavioral economics, financial inclusion, and crime economics, and has contributed to publications in leading academic journals.</p>

      <p>Driven by a deep interest in understanding how economic policies affect development and social welfare, I have led and collaborated on research projects across Latin America and beyond, applying rigorous empirical methods. I am particularly focused on the intersections between organized crime, institutions, and public policy, as well as on how migration dynamics influence economic and social outcomes. I also have a growing interest in public finance with a focus on white-collar crime, and in how such offenses impact state capacity and tax enforcement.</p>
